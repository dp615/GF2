    Home:               Takes the user to the initial signal display page.

    Logic File:         Displays the current logic circuit description file

    CNF Page:        Converts the monitor at the top of the home page into
                        a boolean expression in conjuctive-normal-form
                        allowing for subsequent SAT solving.
                        N.B if the monitor relies on a signal generated by
                        a Flip-Flop or other circular definition items,
                        then the CNF will not be generated.

    Open File:         Open a new logic-circuit description file.

Side Panel: Cycles to Run, Switch On, Signal Monitors

    Cycles to Run:     Set the number of cycles with the spin input box
                        and then click "run" to run the simulator for
                        that many cycles or "continue" to continue the
                        trace simulation for that many cycles.

    Switch On:          Choose a switch from the drop-down box and set
                        its value (the box ticked corresponds to the
                        switch being on).

    Signal Monitors:   Choose a monitor from the drop-down box next to
                        either add or remove and add or remove that
                        signal from the trace display.

    Connections:      Add or remove any connections in the logic
                        circuit description file.
